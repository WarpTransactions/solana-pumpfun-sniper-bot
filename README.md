# Solana Trading Assistant Tool

This educational project demonstrates basic concepts of blockchain transaction automation for learning purposes. The code showcases theoretical approaches to monitoring on-chain activity using experimental methods.

Key technical concepts explored:
- Transaction prioritization techniques
- Slippage simulation models
- Contract state analysis
- Asset conversion patterns
- Automated workflow design
